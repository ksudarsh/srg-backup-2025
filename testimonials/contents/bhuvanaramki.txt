Namaste. It has been over 2years of association with my guru, Smt. Usha Narasimhan. Getting to know her was a life changing for me. She has been very patiently teaching us the Deshikar stotrams and taking Kalakshepams. She has helped me mold myself and taught beautifully as to how one can blend spirituality in our day to day lives. My pranams to God for having introduced me to my Guru, Prathama Acharyan.
