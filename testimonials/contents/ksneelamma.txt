Usha ma'am is an excellent teacher. As well as reciting shlokas, we learn their meanings too. This helps us to visualise while chanting. Chanting shlokas has brought alot of positivity,peace and prosperity to my home as well as increased focus and concentration in my work. I got to know about mythological stories over the classes. The classes are worth the time and I recommend adults n children to join it.
