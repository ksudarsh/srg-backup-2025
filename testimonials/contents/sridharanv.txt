Srimathe Ramanujaya namaha. I am Chithra Sridharan, 65 years, from Pammal, chennai. I joined the class recently only. (6 months) Reciting slokas knowing it's meaning gives strength to my mind. I get ATHMARTHA pleasure and feel going nearer to HIM by attending the kalashebam and sthothra classes of Smt. Usha Narasimhan. I am blessed very much for getting such a nice GURU.
